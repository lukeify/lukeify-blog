The colourway of this blog now matches that of my main site, lukeify.com. I've decided I prefer the purple to blue gradient I have present over my original red to blue fade which covered a larger part of the spectrum. 

Wouldn't it be nice if there was a meta-schema I could define for all my digital & physical assets—site designs, invoice headers, business cards—where a single meta-schema update could be ingested by all my assets and automatically stay in sync.
