When a friend from overseas came to stay in central Wellington in January this year, we found ourselves visiting [Customs by Coffee Supreme](https://www.coffeesupreme.com/locations/new-zealand/wellington/customs) on Ghuznee Street by mere happenstance, due to its proximal location to our hotel—in the heart of central Wellingon—along with its excellent coffee & atmosphere. On an early weekend morning the minimal traffic and shelter from the prevailing winds (Ghuznee is latitudinally-oriented) make it a surprisingly calm & pleasant stop.

The standout feature of this location ended up being something significantly less drinkable, however. It was something neither seen nor mentioned on their website. Customs' Avocado on Toast.

<!-- more --> 

Served on an innocuous light teal rimmed plate, with a firm paper napkin & a vertically-sliced segment of Lemon with about a half-inch thickness; the food is consistently well-presented and displayed in an orderly fashion, the inky black sesame seeds are sure never to be scattered outside of the avocado.

This understated serving cannot be fully appreciated until the first bite has been taken. It took a few visits to fully decipher the flavour profile that hides behind this unassuming implementation of the popular millenial dish, the following recipe represents my summarised conclusion on the matter. 

# Recipe

You can enjoy a faithful reproduction of this excellent morning meal by following the process below.

## Ingredients

* Freshly-baked sourdough bread, cut into an inch-thick slice, toasted until lightly golden on both sides.
* High-grade Avocado. Sliced thinly—no spots or blemishes permitted.
* Labne. Prepared at least a day in advance.
* Chives. Washed and kept damp, patted dry, and sliced into lengths a centimetre long.
* Lemon. Freshly picked.
* Black Sesame Seeds.
* Extra Virgin Olive Oil.
* Rough Sea Salt.
* Cracked pepper.

## Preparation

Start by preparing a labne. Originating from the Mediterranean, this spread is composed of greek yoghurt mixed with salt & juice of a lemon; that has been strained through a cheesecloth for several hours. [I must admit to following another recipe for this](http://theluminouskitchen.com/how-to-make-labne/), and it worked quite well. I tend to find that a day's worth of straining will produce a sufficiently viscous spread that can be stored in the fridge for up to a week.

## Implementation

Once the Labne has refrigerated overnight, take it out to rest & bring it up closer to room temperature. Slice off some sourdough, and toast until lightly golden. Using a butter knife, generously apply the labne to the toast, being sure to spread it to a 90-95% coverage level, right to the edges. One important naunce here is not to apply the spread evenly or to completion—the final product is hand-crafted, and no human is perfect. This dish reflects that.

Take a small pinch of sea salt, and distribute it across the surface of the labne. Although obscured by the Avocado, salt here goes a long way to ensuring the final yield has a consistent level of saltiness across the dish's vertical profile. 

Mildly unripe Avocados tend to have less blemishes than their ready-to-eat companions, and in my opinion, is a necessary requirement of this dish in terms of presentational quality. Ripe avocados tend to deform under handling, tend to be overly soft, and have a propensity for marks & imperfections that are inexcusable for our purposes.

There should be about five to six slices to an inch, and they should be entire Avocado halves, stacked on top of each other—furthermore, they should be skewed—producing an overlay which covers about 70-80% of the toast surface.

Now begins the process of adorning the dish with the remaining condiments. Based on some mild photographic analysis of Custom's implementation, we can deduce the order of operations is salt → pepper → oil → chives → black sesame seeds.

The sea salt & black pepper should be applied while the toast sits on a board, to ensure that none is left resting on the serving plate for presentational purposes. Transfer to plate. Next up, with a fine drizzling implement—a syringe if necessary—apply about a teaspoon of extra virgin olive oil over the avocado & labne. There's no need to be particular here—spilling over the sides of the toast is acceptable.

Finally, sprinkle the chives, followed by the black sesame seeds onto the avocado only. You'll note these are never left to fall onto the toast—a nice touch.

## Serving

Cut a ripe lemon along a vertically-oriented chord, and place beside the avocado on toast. I do suggest utilising this. Serve with a bottle of chilled _Antipodes_ sparkling water, or a latte.
