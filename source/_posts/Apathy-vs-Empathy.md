Intel needs to learn a thing or three from Apple in the world of public responses to drama, it seems. A kernel memory access bug that could date back a decade or more, [first reported on by The Register](https://www.theregister.co.uk/2018/01/02/intel_cpu_design_flaw/), has prompted concerns and criticism from security researchers and developers worldwide. As it should, too, considering there is talk of up to 30% performance losses in some cases involving virtualization. 

Intel's reply to what could be a fairly serious issue can be characterized by two terms: **apathy** and **defensiveness**. Press release [courtesy Intel](https://newsroom.intel.com/news/intel-responds-to-security-research-findings/):

> Intel Responds to Security Research Findings

> Intel and other technology companies have been made aware of new security research describing software analysis methods that, when used for malicious purposes, have the potential to improperly gather sensitive data from computing devices that are operating as designed. Intel believes these exploits do not have the potential to corrupt, modify or delete data.
  
>  Recent reports that these exploits are caused by a “bug” or a “flaw” and are unique to Intel products are incorrect. Based on the analysis to date, many types of computing devices — with many different vendors’ processors and operating systems — are susceptible to these exploits.

Apple recently faced a similar blowback when it was discovered iPhone 6 and newer models may have their CPU throttled when the iPhone battery has a low state of charge, or has degraded significantly. However, despite the severity of the news, their response was well written, alleviated concerns, and illuminated a path forward. More concisely, it could be characterized by **empathy** and **admission**. Press release [courtesy Apple](https://www.apple.com/iphone-battery-and-performance/):

> A Message to Our Customers about iPhone Batteries and Performance

> We’ve been hearing feedback from our customers about the way we handle performance for iPhones with older batteries and how we have communicated that process. We know that some of you feel Apple has let you down. We apologize. There’s been a lot of misunderstanding about this issue, so we would like to clarify and let you know about some changes we’re making.

Note the night and day difference between the two responses here. There isn't a need to even post both in full. The agency of the tone has been conveyed immediately in both letters. Apple's briefing is customer focused, Intel's is more focused on themselves. You can do better than that, Intel.
