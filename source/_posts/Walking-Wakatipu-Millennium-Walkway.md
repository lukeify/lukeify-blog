It would be foolish to live in Queenstown and not embrace the outdoors—as the beginning of my paragliding adventures exemplify—even as winter begins to take hold and the snows start to settle on the peaks of this once-sun-baked basin of beauty. <abbr title="New Zealand's Department of Conservation">DOC</abbr> has compiled [a handy PDF of 43 hikes in the region](https://www.doc.govt.nz/Documents/parks-and-recreation/tracks-and-walks/otago/wakatipu-walks-brochure.pdf), ranging from short strolls to strenous full day outings. What an appropriate mid-term goal it would be to cross these off one step at a time—quite literally. I might as well do just that, and this post is the first of hopefully many in a series that documents these walks so I can not just visually revisit them thanks to Strava+Relive, but experience the same nostalgia in textual form as well.

I try to avoid tourist traps on principle as a rejection of mainstream travel & holiday ideals, doubly so on a public holiday like 25<sup>th</sup> April, ANZAC Day in New Zealand. But, the autumn colours of Arrowtown's decidous trees (technically, these constitute invasive pests) are inescapable, and therefore form the background of the Millennium Walkway, and daywalk #24 in the DOC-provided PDF.

Within minutes of navigating the carparking maze and setting out on the beginning of the beginning, you leave the tourists and their Nikons behind—who generally dare not venture more than a handful of minutes away from paved asphalt. The compacted clay track meanders down, and then up, the Arrow River along what amounts to an approximately 5 kilometre trail that forms a loop, demarcated by two pedestrian bridges across the river at either end; with a shallow gradient to the path in most places.

In typical DOC fashion, the estimated walking times are overstated, the quoted 1 hour 30 minutes was closer to 50, even with an extra kilometre tacked onto the end on my behalf for the purposes of parking. For posterity: 272 calories.

The blue hues of the river's waters intermingle with the saturated yellows of the Willows' last autumn hurrahs. The occasional breeze sends leaves a-scatter, and with a light tap on the head from a leaf now orphaned from its tree, it's clear colder nights are truly on their way.
