In recent weeks—spurred on by New Zealand's summer—I have become enamored with good, high quality milkshakes. Up until recently, I had yet to make one myself that seemed to reach the quality of [Wellington's best](https://concreteplayground.com/wellington/food-drink/ten-best-milkshakes-wellington/); the quality of my own was always subpar: never creamy enough, & always had an unpleasant grittiness from the ice crystals that had accumulated in the creation process.



I've spent some time to familiarise myself with good components of a milkshake, and believe I've arrived at a recipe which rivals an upper-end, store-purchased product. Perfectly creamy, thick enough it has significant weight behind its consumption, yet not thick enough that it blocks the straw, and consistently smooth with no sugar or ice grit.

It starts with the creation of a vanilla syrup. Adding sugar directly to your blender will result in grittiness and not confer the entirety of the sweetness to the drinker. I followed this recipe from [fountainavenuekitchen.com](https://fountainavenuekitchen.com/simple-vanilla-syrup/). Make sure you use _actual_ vanilla extract and not some trashy vanilla-like flavoring. 

> INGREDIENTS
> * 1 cup water
> * 1 cup sugar
> * 1 tablespoon pure vanilla extract
    
> INSTRUCTIONS
    
> Bring the water and sugar to a boil in a medium saucepan over medium high heat. Continue to cook at a rapid simmer until the mixture thickens slightly, about 8-9 minutes.
> Remove the pan from the heat, stir in the vanilla, and cool to room temperature. Transfer to a glass jar or bottle and refrigerate. The syrup will last for two weeks or more. Eventually, the sugar will begin to crystalize on the side of the jar or bottle, but the taste will likely still be fine.

I then chilled this for at least 30 minutes in the fridge before use. At the same time, I transferred my glass, the straw, and the blender to the fridge too. Doing so removes any latent heat, ensuring the milkshake is served at as low of a temperature as possible.

My ingredients were as follows. This will make 2 small shakes, or 1 large shake.

* 6 dessertspoon scoops of [**Deep South Vanilla Bean Ice Cream**](https://www.deepsouthicecream.co.nz/product-page/vanilla-bean-950ml). I am convinced you need a high quality ice cream to make this recipe functional; low fat and lower quality ice creams are diluted with water which freeze, transferring grit into the final product.

* ¼ cup of **High Quality Cream**. Not whipped cream in a can. Buy actual, decent cream. Double cream is even better. This crucially fills in the gap between the chunkiness of the ice cream and the liquidity of the milk.

* 1 cup of [**Lewis Road non-homogenised Whole Milk**](https://lewisroadcreamery.co.nz/products/fridge/milk#pure-organic-non-homogenised). Again, avoid anything that contains extra water. Skim, trim, and low-fat will not work. A good milkshake is *meant* to be bad for you. Embrace it.

* A pinch of **Salt**. Enhances the flavor profile of the final product.

* A pinch of **Xanthum Gum**. You could probably eliminate this by constraining the amount of milk you introduce, but this seems to tighten up the final product well, yielding a viscosity somewhere between milkshake and thickshake.

The instructions are deliciously simple.

1. Once your glasses & blender are chilled, remove the blender container from the fridge and add the ingredients. Also add 1 tablespoon of your vanilla syrup.

2. Blend on high for at least a minute. Don't get ahead of yourself; do the full minute, then pulse it for another minute.

3. Wobble/shake the container backwards and forwards for a minute to fold the bubbles into the rest of the mix.

4. Serve immediately.
